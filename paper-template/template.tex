  \begin{abstract}
    This is a paper for educational purposed written by five students of \emph{TUM for the The EU’s Draft AI Act: From framework to practical application} Seminar in the WS 22/23. In this paper we wrote an introduction to the EU's Draft AI Act and the Fraunhofer’s \emph{Automatic and Pre-dictive Traffic Light Systems for Public Roads}. Following this we applied the Articles of the AIA to the AI system of Fraunhofer and wrote a technical documentation with the information we got from them about the model as required by the AIA. The paper is closed by a ethical analysis of any dangers this system poses.
