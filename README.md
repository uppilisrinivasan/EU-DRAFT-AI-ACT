# A Technical And Ethical Analysis Of ‘Automatic and Predictive Traffic Light Systems for Public Roads’ In The Context Of The European AI Act

This is a paper for educational purposes written by five students of TUM for the The EU’s Draft AI Act: From framework to practical application Seminar in the WS 22/23. 
In this paper we wrote an introduction to the EU’s Draft AI Act and the Fraunhofer’s Automatic and Predictive Traffic Light Systems for Public Roads.
Following this we applied the Articles of the AIA to the AI system of Fraunhofer and wrote a technical documentation with the information we got from them about the model as required by the AIA. 
The paper is closed by a ethical analysis of any dangers this system poses.
